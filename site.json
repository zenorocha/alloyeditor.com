And not only to separate it, but to give opportunity to people to add very easy new Buttons and Toolbars or to create completely new UI, based on different Framework or vanilla JavaScript. Architecture Core Built on top of CKEditor AlloyEditor uses CKEditor under the hood to deal with the HTML. Browsers still generate very inconsistent HTML, not to mention how buggy they are. In fact, to create an editor, which is able to handle all browsers, let's say IE9+, Chrome, Firefox and Safari, is very challenging. Fortunately, CKEditor does it well, so it was the natural choice not only because of that, but because it is mature, well documented and configurable. Not everything from CKEditor is being used. In fact, AlloyEditor uses only the core from it. The whole UI has been discarded and the version of CKEditor which comes in AlloyEditor is twice smaller than the version OOTB. Plugins and UI Core On top of what CKEditor provides, new plugins and modules were created, which form the core of AlloyEditor. Among these plugins is a plugin, which adds new functions which provide information about the selection - its regions, direction and so on. This is the key part and that is what allows the Toolbars to display themselves just above or below the selection. Other plugins are related to Drag&Drop of images directly in the editor, or they provide common API for creating, editing and removing links and so on. There is no much dependency of CKEditor in AlloyEditor. If there is better base, or if we reach the point when creation of new core would be easier but we still will be able to support the majority of the browsers, nothing prevents us of replacing CKEditor core with our own. UI The UI has been thought in the way that it should provide the following functionality: Toolbars should allow adding, removing and reordering Buttons. The developer should be able to add new Toolbars to the editor. It should be easy to create a new UI. The default one uses React. However, if a developer wants to use another Framework or to create UI using vanilla JavaScript and CSS - that should be possible. Currently AlloyEditor supports only one UI - it uses React. Please feel free to contact us if you want to contribute another UI.

Different skins may use different components, so irrelevant styling can be easily stripped out. Structure vs Skin All styling is separated into structure and skin. Structure represents everything that affects the sizing and position of the elements. Meanwhile, skin represents all the purely cosmetic changes.

You may remove any of those and the toolbar won't be shown when user makes the corresponding selection. To remove the toolbar for adding content, just remove the property add var toolbars = { styles: { selections: AlloyEditor.Selections, tabIndex: 1 } }; Configuring Buttons In the default UI, which uses React, some of the buttons accept configuration parameters so you can tailor them to suit your needs. Here is an example of a custom configuration for the Styles button inside a text selection var Selections = [{ name: 'text', buttons: [ { name: 'styles', cfg: { styles: [...] } }, 'bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'link', 'twitter' ], test: AlloyEditor.SelectionTest.text }]; In this case a different array of styles is passed to the Styles button, so they will be shown when user selects a text instead of the default ones. Reordering Buttons If you are not happy with the order of the buttons, you can just reorder them in the toolbar configuration. They will follow the order in which you specify them. For example, if you want the table button to appear before the hline button in the Add toolbar, you just need to do the following: var toolbars = { add: { buttons: ['table', 'hline', image', 'camera'], tabIndex: 2 } }; If you remove a button from the buttons property of a toolbar, or from the selections in Styles toolbar, then this button won't be available when the toolbar gets visible.
